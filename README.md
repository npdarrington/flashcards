# Flashcard Game

Terminal based Flashcards game by Nathan Darrington

### Project Overview

The Flashcards game is a terminal based game that will lead a user through a series of flash cards inside of a deck. When a user answers a question it will return them a correct or incorrect answer. After the game has been completed, a user will have their correct percentage returned to them. This project was developed primarily through Test Driven Development and features a multiple robust testing suite.
